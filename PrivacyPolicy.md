# Privacy Policy

Mink reads the URI you requested and submits this URI as a parameter to a 
Memento aggregator. A Memento TimeMap is returned and cached in your copy of 
Google Chrome for quick recall when you visit the page again instead of needing 
to query the Memento aggregator. Beyond TimeMap caching, Mink does not send 
URIs you visit to any service other than the Memento aggregator.
